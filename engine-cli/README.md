After you click OK, the engine automatically generates a src folder that contains the selected content.
For first-time users, you are advised to create a simple page that does not contain internationalization. Then copy the generated page to the src/view directory of the project and run it directly.

For users who use the source code for multiple times, you are advised to select the src of the project when generating the source code. When generating the source code, generate the corresponding file as required.
